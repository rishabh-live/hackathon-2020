We tend to bend our hunches towards competitions, huge crowds, and cultural diversities which indeed gifts you a massive package of memories.\r\nKnowing people, working with them and understanding them is like the crux of every fest. Interactions with different ideological personalities, add a bit more of the spice to your experience.\r\nBut that's not all that you get from a fest, there are a plenty of things that one learns while engulfing himself\/herself into a fest. So, we brought you a list of things that you take home, apart from memories when partaking in a fest.\r\nYou learn to get out of your comfort zone.\r\nFests mean, 'Few Earn Stages To Shine', which indeed tells us that fests provide a platform where you could enhance your socialising and communication skills. It is always the stage that we fear the most and the only way possible to curb this phobia is extensively indulging self into fests that push you to step on the stage.\r\nKnowing the neighbour.\r\nStudents these days are so much induced into social media that they don't observe the real-life relations. A fest, on the other hand, drives you to come out of your digital world and build deeper connections with someone, that you may know a little less. A fest encourages you to, 'interact with people around by putting your phone down'.\r\nExplore your leadership skills.\r\nFests are not always organised to give a prezzie of memories to students, it lends a great platform to enhance and explore your leading skills. Not everyone is a born leader but could eventually turn into one by constantly scratching at the edges.\r\nYou learn to spend quality time.\r\nThese days, life is becoming faster and faster. Everyone is running, either to make a living or in the hopes of development and growth. With such a routine, it is hard for students to build strong relations and spend some quality time with them.\r\nLooking for a fest?Kaalrav 2k20, could be the best.\r\nA fest that brings students from different states under the same roof and gives them a chance to compete with each other. The tech fest does not end with this, a lot of motivational speeches by some of the well-known personalities, are also knocking your doors. The fest is going to serve you a varied amount of events, both related to technology and management.","tag":"kaalrav,smit, 2020,fest","cat":"lifestyle","date":"10-Feb-2020","time":"12:39:57","author":"ADMIN","picture":""},{"id":"5e405ca6ad377","title":"SMIT Girl Scales New Height","body":"When the Indian Navy welcomed its first woman pilot, with Sub Lieutenant Shivangi taking control of an aircraft in another significant milestone for the country\u2019s armed forces, it was also celebration time for the premier engineering college in Sikkim.\r\nAs Shivangi, 24, was given her wings and joined naval operations at the Kochi naval base on December 2, it was a proud moment for Sikkim Manipal Institute of Technology (SMIT) under Sikkim Manipal University (SMU).
